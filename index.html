            <h1>KUMOKO</h1>
            
            <p>
                A high school girl of self-professed low standing who has reincarnated as a spider. In her former life, she lived as a shut-in and immersed herself in video games, but now she uses her remarkable mental strength to fight for survival. She uses battle tactics that make up for her low stats with her mastery of agility, spider thread, and poison fangs.

                <a href="https://anilist.co/character/122124/Kumoko" target="_blank">Shiraori üîó</a> came into being when <strong>Kumoko</strong> eats a GMA Bomb in a panic because it was going to explode, thinking maybe she could digest and absorb it in a similar fashion to <strong>Ariel's</strong> skill Gluttony. The GMA Bomb was being used as a generator to power a large pre-system flying machine and its army of fighters and robots. Devices that utilized MA Energy as a power source is the technology that led to the destruction of the world and the necessity of the System. After absorbing the MA Energy from the GMA Bomb, <strong>Kumoko</strong> reaches Divinity Expansion Level 10 and undergoes Apotheosis, transcending the system, and is reborn as <a href="https://anilist.co/character/122124/Kumoko" target="_blank">Shiraori üîó</a> after 47 days.
